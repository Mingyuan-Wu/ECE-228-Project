# Soblev-training based neural networks (ECE-228-Project)
This repository contains code for ECE 228 project and assignment.  
There are three files.

1.File GPU autoencoder has the assignment which uses the autoencoder for image compression and abnormal data detection.
2.File Analysis has the code for Sobolev trainging on the dataset https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ngpd634smf/1  
  There are seperate codes for ANN, SANN and mSANN. It also has a combination code of the three models
3.File Newdatabase has the ANN model trained from our generated data. The data is generated from Xfoil.
